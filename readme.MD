#Bash script for generating a random password
Takes the desired length as the only arguement. Outputs letters, numbers and symbols (no spaces).

Example usage:

./gen.sh 20 #this will echo you out 20 random characters



##Disclaimer:
Don't use this for anything even vaguely important. I know nothing, dont trust me. This is my third bash script ever.
